## Folder contents
* Enclosure design, created in Fusion 360
  * STL exports of the parts that need to be 3D printed
  * an SVG containing the outline for laser cuttig the diffusor. It is included in three variants that account for different laser kerfs so that the diffusor fits tightly in the main part of the enclosure

## Hints
* It seems inserting the diffusor slightly warps/bends the main enclosure part. This can lead to a slight bulging of the back lid. I removed some material towards the top end of the lid where the M2 screw goes to reduce the warping of the back lid.
